### Hybridverse's Origins
The entire Hybridverse was thought out gradually, beggining with **Viktor's Diary**, followed by **Hybridverse I**, and finally other books that are still going to be announced.

Despite this, several of them have been and are being written at the same time, thus creating stories connected to each other.

I've been planning, reviewing, and writing these stories for over 5 years now.
Originally, the story was an adaptation of the animated series of Minecraft named "[**Endventures**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXL4PHuay34)", by [Willcraft Animations](http://youtube.com/diedie15).
Gradually, the adaptation was getting more and more distinct until, finally, I decided to rewrite, this time without Minecraft references. From this, the **Hybridverse** series was created.

### References and Inspirations

**Hybridverse I** was my first original story, inspired by *Inuyasha*, *Skyrim*, *[TwoKinds](http://twokinds.keenspot.com/)*, etc.
The main point of the series is to establish the locations and characters of the series, and so the book's full of annotations and doodles.
It was also the most difficult series to write, as there are constant changes in the other series that are reflected in this.

**Di√°rio do Viktor**, as already said before, was the result of severe rewrites of many stories, and also the story that took more time to be written.
The current version is a mix of 3 other stories, which made it much more dynamic.
